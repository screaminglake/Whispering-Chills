# 4.1

    -More streamlined intro/setup...No opening cutscene or white foggy fade-in (Intro Tweaks mod).  Setup process has been mostly automated via M8r's brilliant MCM Settings Manager and MCM settings menu conversions for holotapes so be sure to revisit the website documentation as some steps have changed!
    -Item sorting and tagging with automated integration of recipes into ECO's universal workbench using FallUI Item Sorter, Icon Library, and Complex Sorter!
    -Reworked levelled lists to remove pukers, spitters, and most FGEP creatures so now creatures should be largely just zombies and paranormal entities
    -Added Fatigue - Enhanced Combat Realism which introduces wobble to the weapon when aiming down sights and also drains AP when firing down sights.  This can be disabled or tweaked to your liking in its MCM (See-Through Scopes also added as requirement but disabled via replacer ESP) 
    -Added Bullet in the Chamber purely for its Ammo Check (T hotkey) and lower/holster weapon (Y hotkey) functionality
    -Complete audio update/overhaul following a huge update to Lost Audio Tweaks introducing even more QoL audio edits and consistency between audio mods also now featuring Reverb and Ambience Overhaul - Tweaked for less problematic reverb effects, Melee Impact Overhaul, and Ambient Tunnels of Boston for even more spooky ambient sound effects down in the (vanilla) subway tunnels
    -Related to above, FINALLY patched out the heavy male breathing that would occur at low health (even on female characters) due to GRIM.  Took me a long time to recognize this was not vanilla and determine the cause to resolve but glad it's gone now!
    -Removed _balance_ now allowing Game Configuration Menu to determine incoming and outgoing damages exclusively with no more annoying combat effects that mod brought with it!
    -General performance optimizations (ensured proper previs/precombine carried over to Sweet Whispers for each cell/worldspaces.  Also INI tweaks)
    -Added Dark Sci-Fi Vault Retexture (it's back!)
    -Added Nightmare Raiders (some human apocalyptic fanatics can be found around the Commonwealth.  Don't feel ashamed having to defend yourself against them.  They've completely lost it!)
    -Added MCM Booster
    -Added Looks Menu Customization Compendium Fix
    -Added Leon's Outfit to starting chest (yes THAT Leon's outfit from Resident Evil)

    -Updated South of the Sea - Atom's Storm
    -Updated Workshop Framework
    -Updated FallUI - HUD

# 4.0 - Ultimate Survival Horror Overhaul Update!

    The brunt of this update was made possible thanks to the hard work of Sweet6Shooter who took it upon themselves to entirely overhaul almost every aspect of Whispering Chills in their unofficial addon Sweet Whispers (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/64130) and has done truly amazing work on it.  Be sure to thank them in our Discord server!  Here is a generalized summary of some of the major changes, but I highly recommend reading through the description and changelog for Sweet Whispers to understand everything that has now changed in WC:
    -Almost all enemies have been renamed in a WC lore-consistent way
    -The stash behind the player home has been rebalanced to contain only absolute necessities and badass new apparel items
    -Perk system has been entirely overhauled and there should no longer be any perks that are irrelevant in the context of WC
    -All vanilla armors have been renamed to be consistent with a world not tied to F4
    -Can't scrap houses in workshop mode and anything irrelevant to WC is no longer available to craft in workshop
    -All ingestibles and chems have been renamed to something reflective of reality (i.e. stimpak = health stim; jet = methamphetamine, etc) and no more rad-based medication available to find or loot since there is no radiation in WC
    -All PA frames and pieces placed in the game have been removed
    -Less ammo and stim loot overall
    -Balancing to incoming and outgoing damage which will be refined more over time.  Many attributes of all creatures have been edited as well as in relation to the player for a more fair and consistent survival horror experience
    -Added game config menu so users can tweak settings to their needs
    -Weapons may occasionally jam.  Also no more automatic reloading.  You will have to reload manually each time you run out of ammo.  Reloading before the clip is empty results in you dropping ammo in the clip (and thereby actually losing ammo) but you can pick it up after the fact if you drop it by accident and remember to do so
    -Rewrite and rebalance of the Vault 1080 worldspace and questline
    -No more legendary, armor, weapon, or junk crafting via ECO's universal workbench
