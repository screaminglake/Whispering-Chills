# 5.0 (Prerelease) - Massive Overhaul!

## Major Changes

-Major gameplay changes have been set forth that will force you to re-evaluate how you play WC and Fallout 4 in general.  A new blocking system where you can no longer just cheese your way through every combat encounter with melee.  Enemy attacks break blocks causing you to stagger and drain AP, leaving you vulnerable and some enemies can't be blocked. (Blocking Overhaul).  Cars can no longer be used as an easy "get out of combat for free with a big explosion card" as all vehicles have been retextured to fit the setting, are indestructible, and set off a car alarm whenever shot that attracts all nearby enemies, making stealth and carefully placed shots more important than ever (Elzee Car Alarms).  In the world of robotics, robot companions and pods that you could activate for safety are no longer present (Looted Robots).  Additionally, generators have been deactivated with their fusion cores removed and all associated light sources turned off (Depleted Fusion Generators).  And to make matters even worse, loot that you would expect to find typically in locations for vanilla have been removed in large swaths.  Resources are now harder than ever to come by, so make every bullet and aid item count (Looted World).  <br />

-To make up for the reduction of loot overall, several buildings across the Commonwealth previously closed off in vanilla have now been opened and reimagined with custom environments and loot in locations such as Cambridge, Lexington, Malden, and several others.  More to explore as you desperately scrounge to survive (Open Commonwealth)  <br />

-Now it isn't just the Commonwealth that this paranormal curse has inhabited.  The Wilderness mod in previous versions of the list makes a return as well as the new addition of Point Lookout.  And with both of these, the fogs of Silent Hill roll into them as well.  See both environments in a terrifying new light like never before.  All NPC's have been retained in Point Lookout for those wanting to play through the story, but the intention is more just to provide a new environment to explore so I have tested playing through it in WC.  Point Lookout now plays like a new Silent Hill with fog, creatures, and music imported from Whispering Hills.  <br />

-Ingestibles now include custom animations, and with that, drugs have been entirely reworked with new names and retextures that align with real-world drugs for that extra bit of grounded immersion.  Ever wanted to see what it looks like to huff cocaine as a means of coping with the eternal dread surrounding you in Fallout 4?  Now you can (Modern Pharmacy, Immersive Animation Framework)!  <br />

-A whole new line of creatures have been introduced into this update and all levelled lists for spawns have been remixed every 5 levels to include more variety than ever to hopefully eliminate some redundancies between enemy types. (Wasteland Bestiary - Wendigos, A Haunting)  <br />

# 4.3 - The DEMENTIA Update!

## Major Changes

-Full texture overhaul of most things in the game to match the horror aesthetic including landscape, set dressing, architecture, interiors, mannequins, crates, and more!  Rust, decay, and unease runs through every inch of the Commonwealth now.  This is not the Commonwealth you know and recognize any longer.  Big credits to Project Dementia and MikMet (HappoMatka) for the brunt of the work here and expect more retextures from them fitting the horror vibe in the future! <br />

-Addition of PTSD Mental Health Management System (credits to the author Ghostfc3s for all their help in making this work with WC).  To reinforce the idea that you are not meant to be an unstoppable killing machine, illing certain enemies will project a paranoid sense of mental deterioration upon you which will lead to things like night terrors when sleeping, hallucinations, and other disorienting side effects.  You must do things to lower your "PTSD level" such as consume drugs/alcohol, sleep more than 8 hours, consume antidepressants (can be purchased from robot vendors), or pet dogs.  Most aspects of the mod can be configured in the Mental Health Settings holotape.  I recommend turning off HUD overlays in the holotape after doing initial setup.  And if you come to find this system isn't to your liking you can disable/uncheck PTSD Mental Health Management System and the MHWH mod below it in the left pane of MO2 at the bottom of the Gameplay separator.  You will have to start a new game after doing this. <br />

-Huge update to the Feed Me to the Monsters quest mod added in the previous update.  Spawn issues should be ironed out and entirely new areas to explore and quest sections have been fleshed out.  Seriously check out this mod when playing WC as the quality is on par with Whispering Hills! <br />

## Other Changes

-Added Illumination Glow Maps AIO to make certain objects that should glow in the dark actually do so <br />
-Added Concord Personified for more places to explore in Concord (if you're brave enough!) <br />

-ENB preset update with slight tweaks to account for new textures; update to latest ENB libraries <br />
-Updated patches as necessary for aforementioned updates



# 4.2

    -General damage balancing making enemies not bullet sponges and also giving them logical weak points based on anatomy to kill faster
    -AI/stealth detection edits from 4estGimp AI Edits and Stealth Detection System to make stealth more viable

# 4.1

    -More streamlined intro/setup...No opening cutscene or white foggy fade-in (Intro Tweaks mod).  Setup process has been mostly automated via M8r's brilliant MCM Settings Manager and MCM settings menu conversions for holotapes so be sure to revisit the website documentation as some steps have changed!
    -Item sorting and tagging with automated integration of recipes into ECO's universal workbench using FallUI Item Sorter, Icon Library, and Complex Sorter!
    -Reworked levelled lists to remove pukers, spitters, and most FGEP creatures so now creatures should be largely just zombies and paranormal entities
    -Added Fatigue - Enhanced Combat Realism which introduces wobble to the weapon when aiming down sights and also drains AP when firing down sights.  This can be disabled or tweaked to your liking in its MCM (See-Through Scopes also added as requirement but disabled via replacer ESP) 
    -Added Bullet in the Chamber purely for its Ammo Check (T hotkey) and lower/holster weapon (Y hotkey) functionality
    -Complete audio update/overhaul following a huge update to Lost Audio Tweaks introducing even more QoL audio edits and consistency between audio mods also now featuring Reverb and Ambience Overhaul - Tweaked for less problematic reverb effects, Melee Impact Overhaul, and Ambient Tunnels of Boston for even more spooky ambient sound effects down in the (vanilla) subway tunnels
    -Related to above, FINALLY patched out the heavy male breathing that would occur at low health (even on female characters) due to GRIM.  Took me a long time to recognize this was not vanilla and determine the cause to resolve but glad it's gone now!
    -Removed _balance_ now allowing Game Configuration Menu to determine incoming and outgoing damages exclusively with no more annoying combat effects that mod brought with it!
    -General performance optimizations (ensured proper previs/precombine carried over to Sweet Whispers for each cell/worldspaces.  Also INI tweaks)
    -Added Dark Sci-Fi Vault Retexture (it's back!)
    -Added Nightmare Raiders (some human apocalyptic fanatics can be found around the Commonwealth.  Don't feel ashamed having to defend yourself against them.  They've completely lost it!)
    -Added MCM Booster
    -Added Looks Menu Customization Compendium Fix
    -Added Leon's Outfit to starting chest (yes THAT Leon's outfit from Resident Evil)

# 4.0 - Ultimate Survival Horror Overhaul Update!

    The brunt of this update was made possible thanks to the hard work of Sweet6Shooter who took it upon themselves to entirely overhaul almost every aspect of Whispering Chills in their unofficial addon Sweet Whispers (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/64130) and has done truly amazing work on it.  Be sure to thank them in our Discord server!  Here is a generalized summary of some of the major changes, but I highly recommend reading through the description and changelog for Sweet Whispers to understand everything that has now changed in WC:
    -Almost all enemies have been renamed in a WC lore-consistent way
    -The stash behind the player home has been rebalanced to contain only absolute necessities and badass new apparel items
    -Perk system has been entirely overhauled and there should no longer be any perks that are irrelevant in the context of WC
    -All vanilla armors have been renamed to be consistent with a world not tied to F4
    -Can't scrap houses in workshop mode and anything irrelevant to WC is no longer available to craft in workshop
    -All ingestibles and chems have been renamed to something reflective of reality (i.e. stimpak = health stim; jet = methamphetamine, etc) and no more rad-based medication available to find or loot since there is no radiation in WC
    -All PA frames and pieces placed in the game have been removed
    -Less ammo and stim loot overall
    -Balancing to incoming and outgoing damage which will be refined more over time.  Many attributes of all creatures have been edited as well as in relation to the player for a more fair and consistent survival horror experience
    -Added game config menu so users can tweak settings to their needs
    -Weapons may occasionally jam.  Also no more automatic reloading.  You will have to reload manually each time you run out of ammo.  Reloading before the clip is empty results in you dropping ammo in the clip (and thereby actually losing ammo) but you can pick it up after the fact if you drop it by accident and remember to do so
    -Rewrite and rebalance of the Vault 1080 worldspace and questline
    -No more legendary, armor, weapon, or junk crafting via ECO's universal workbench
