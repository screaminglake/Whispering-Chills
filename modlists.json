    "description": "Whispering Chills is a horror experience unlike any other. It\u0027s intended to be entirely standalone in that you don\u0027t need to enjoy or know very well how to play Fallout 4 to be able to enjoy it as a horror fan in general. Perfect for anyone experiencing burnout in their other modded setups. It is about as lore-unfriendly as you can get purely using the engine as a vessel to craft an entirely new experience through a unique combination of mods that enhance/rework its core mechanics and add new content that entirely change its core focus. Your ultimate goal and place in this hellscape is for you to decide. If you\u0027re looking for something DIFFERENT in your modded experience, THIS IS IT!",
